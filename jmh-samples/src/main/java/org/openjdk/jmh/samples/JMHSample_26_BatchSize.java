     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * You can see completely different results for measureWrong_1 and measureWrong_5; this
     * is because the workload has no steady state. The result of the workload is dependent
     * on the measurement time. measureRight does not have this drawback, because it measures
     * the N invocations of the test method and measures it's time.
     *
     * We measure batch of 5000 invocations and consider the batch as the single operation.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar ".*JMHSample_26.*" -f 1
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
